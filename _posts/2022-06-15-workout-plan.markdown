Since lockdown has begun, workout is something that I'm interested to do. I've been doing it for almost 9 months and losing around 7 kg in weight. Here are some steps that I do to start a workout routine

###  Step 1: Follow this SMART goals
<b>1. Make It S: Specific</b>
In order for a goal to be effective, it needs to be specific.

A specific goal would answer questions like:

What needs to be achieved?
* What steps will I need to take to achieve the desired result?
* Remember not to choose something too vague as a goal. For example, Instead of writing your goal as “get healthy”, be more specific about it like “lose weight”.  Doing this will lead you in the right direction when creating a workout plan.

<b> 2. Make It M: Measurable </b>
“Lose weight” definitely makes it clearer what you want to achieve but you should also add the answer to the question “how much?”

A goal like “lose 5kgs” will help you track your progress and know how close or far you are in reaching your goal.

Goals can be anything like walking 3km or spending 3 hours in the gym. You just need to make sure they are quantifiable.

<b> 3. Make It A: Attainable </b>
I know you must be feeling super motivated right now with your decision to workout. You probably feel like you can start working out every single day of the week for 5 hours non- stop.

There are times when in the excitement of a decision we make, we set our goals a little too high and then feel frustrated for not able to achieve them.

No need to be embarrassed. Trust me, we’ve all been there.

So here’s an advice: Start small.

Sure, having a long term goal in mind helps, but the joy of achieving even those small goals is immeasurable. When you achieve your small goals and get that boost in confidence you can challenge yourself for more. Starting like this will make you a master planner in no time.

BE REALISTIC. Setting unrealistic goals will only lead you to disappointment. Consider your everyday schedule and try to figure out how much time you can (realistically) give to training. 

<b> 4. Make It R: Relevant </b>
Now here’s a rather difficult but an important question: Why are setting the goal you’re setting? Is it really worthwhile or are you really motivated enough to achieve that goal?

I am not trying to demotivate you but creating a goal without a good enough reason attached to it will make it harder for you to stay motivated.

Think about it, why do you want to lose weight? Is it to look more confident in a dress at the party next month? Attaching such reasons to your goals will make them relevant and help you stay motivated till you reach that goal.

<b> 5. Make it T: Time-bounded </b>
So when are you planning to start this routine? How much time do you want to give yourself to accomplish that goal?

Now let’s be honest, who doesn’t love to procrastinate? You’ll never accomplish your goals if you haven’t set a deadline. We humans need to feel that urgency to actually get serious about anything.

I’ll remind you again: Make sure the time limits you are setting are realistic.

At the same time, stay focused on your goal; don’t give yourself too much time because that will make you lethargic.

Obviously, making your goals time bounded will also help you in tracking your progress.


###  Step 2: Write Your Workout Schedule
Now that you know how to create SMART goals, it’s now time to create a schedule.

Following are some of the basic questions you will need an answer to, to create a schedule:

* How many days per week will I workout?
* What will be those specific days?
* What time will I workout?
* How long will those workouts last?
* How many rest days should I take? ( very very important)
You need to build a plan with the right mixture of activity and rest. If you’re a beginner doing splits you will probably need two days of rest in a week.

Don’t make your schedule too rigid. Life is unpredictable and not every little thing can go according to your plan. So, make sure to incorporate chances of any uncertainties and keep the schedule flexible.

###  Step 3: Plan your exercises
Whether your goal is to get in shape, build muscle or anything related to staying fit, as a beginner following are the 3 basic things everybody should focus on:

1. Cardio: This includes any exercise that gets your heart rate up from walking to cycling. Following are a few easy ones:
* Burpees
* Squat jumps
* Jump ropes
* Swimming
* Jumping jacks
* Jogging

2. Stretching exercises: Stretching helps in improving flexibility and is important so you don’t get injured during your workouts. It also helps your body recover after a workout. No matter what exercise you do stretching should be included in every workout.

3. Weight training: If your goal is building muscle, this is obviously a must. But even if that isn’t your goal you should lift. It will make your muscles stronger and boost your metabolism.

You can now make your schedules more detailed by focusing on specific exercises on a specific set of days.

###  Step 4: Choose Your Workout Split
A “workout split” in simple words refers to dividing your training sessions into different body regions.

You can follow any sequence for this; as an example-

* Day1- legs

* Day2- shoulders and biceps

* Day3- chest and back

* Day4- Cardio

And then repeat the cycle again.

How to choose the best workout split for you?

You’ll require some hit and trial to make a split that works best for you. It might even change with time depending on factors like your current condition, recovery needs and your goal at the time.

###  Step 5: Adapt to Your Plan and Track Your Progress

With all the steps above, you should now have come up with a workout plan. So now it’s time to execute those plans!!!

For tracking your progress the first thing that probably pops in your mind is “weight”. It makes sense if your end goal was to attain weight in a specific range.

<b> CAUTION</b>: Weight might not be a helpful measure if you’re following a resistance based training program. The issue at hand is: you might lose body fat and gain muscle but the weighing scale won’t take that in account.

Other ways to track your progress:

* Record your measurements: You can use a measuring tape to measure your chest, bicep, etc. Recording it over time will make you aware of any changes and check on any developments.
* Keep a log: Record the exercises you are doing, the weight you are lifting, and the time you are taking to complete an exercise. Maintaining these records will help you know your weaknesses and strong points.

<b> What after tracking? </b>
The objective of maintaining records is to reflect and improve yourself.

<b> Ask yourself: </b>
* In what areas can I improve?
* Do I need to take out more time?
* Should I challenge myself more?
* Should I try doing things differently? Do I need to make changes in my schedule?

After evaluating your progress, now that you know what’s working and what’s not you will probably make some changes in your schedule, which will help you plan ahead for the future.

Try to follow the plan as closely as possible. There will be days where you won’t be able to give as much time you wanted to, but DON’T GIVE UP!! And remember that “something is always better than nothing”
