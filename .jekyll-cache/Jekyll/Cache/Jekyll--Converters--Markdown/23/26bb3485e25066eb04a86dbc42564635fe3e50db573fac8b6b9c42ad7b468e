<p>I didnâ€™t study linguistics. I studied science technology, but language-learning is my passion. Iâ€™ve been studying English, Korean, Arabic and Chinese languages by my own for years. The language-learning process will depend on your personal learning style. However, thereâ€™s still some methods that work for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-method-i-follow-to-learn-languages">The method I follow to learn languages</h2>
<p><b> Study phonetics for about 1 month  In the very beginning, </b> I spend about a month practicing the sounds of the language and learning how to read it. Itâ€™s crucial that you learn correct pronunciation, so that people can understand you. Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet and use recordings from a book (or online) to learn all the sounds (vowels, consonants, special sounds, etc.).</p>

<p><b> Start learning (thousands of ) words </b> And lots of them! At this point, the quickest way of gaining fluency is to learn the 1000-1500 most frequent words in your language. Use a frequency dictionary and a flashcard app like Anki to learn at least 15 words a day. Personally, I think 20 words/day is best.
Think about it, 20 words a day (every day) become 3000 words after 5 months of studying! Thatâ€™s enough to understand 80% of everything you read.</p>

<p><b> At the 100-200 word milestone, start learning the basics of grammar. </b> That means learning how are verbs conjugated and how do prepositions fit in a sentence. Use that knowledge to create more complete flashcards, i.e. for every verb write all the conjugations in the back of the card.</p>

<p><b> Throughout the whole learning process, listen to the same recordings over and over again. </b> This step really makes your skills shine. Download podcasts or news and listen to them repeatedly. The same ones until you have it almost memorized. Repeat them orally after the recordings. If youâ€™re walking around campus, recite the recordings out loud (avoid being institutionalized, though).</p>

<p><b> At the 2000-2500 word milestone, find someone to speak to. </b> There are tons of places online where you can do this. Search for the appropriate subreddits or language learning forums to find a language learning pal!</p>

<p><b> Tips <b></b></b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Study a little bit everyday. Thatâ€™s also the magic of Anki, it forces you to review everyday otherwise cards will pile up.</li>
  <li>Remember that learning a language fluently takes years. Not days, weeks or months, but years.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t get discouraged by slow progress, thatâ€™s just how it works.</li>
  <li>Get reading material in the target language about subjects youâ€™re interested in.</li>
</ul>
