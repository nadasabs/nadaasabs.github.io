I"<p>Since lockdown has begun, workout is something that I‚Äôve been interested to do. I‚Äôve been doing it for almost 9 months and I lost around 7 kg in weight. Here are some steps that I do to start a workout routine</p>

<h3 id="step-1-follow-this-smart-tips">Step 1: Follow this SMART tips</h3>
<p><b>1. Make It S: Specific</b>
In order for a goal to be effective, it needs to be specific.</p>

<p>A specific goal would answer questions like:</p>

<p>What needs to be achieved?</p>
<ul>
  <li>What steps will I need to take to achieve the desired result?</li>
  <li>Remember not to choose something too vague as a goal. For example, Instead of writing your goal as ‚Äúget healthy‚Äù, be more specific about it like ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù.  Doing this will lead you in the right direction when creating a workout plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><b> 2. Make It M: Measurable </b>
‚ÄúLose weight‚Äù definitely makes it clearer what you want to achieve but you should also add the answer to the question ‚Äúhow much?‚Äù</p>

<p>A goal like ‚Äúlose 5kgs‚Äù will help you track your progress and know how close or far you are in reaching your goal.</p>

<p>Goals can be anything like walking 3km or spending 3 hours in the gym. You just need to make sure they are quantifiable.</p>

<p><b> 3. Make It A: Attainable </b>
I know you must be feeling super motivated right now with your decision to workout. You probably feel like you can start working out every single day of the week for 5 hours non- stop.</p>

<p>There are times when in the excitement of a decision we make, we set our goals a little too high and then feel frustrated for not able to achieve them.</p>

<p>No need to be embarrassed. Trust me, we‚Äôve all been there.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs an advice: Start small.</p>

<p>Sure, having a long term goal in mind helps, but the joy of achieving even those small goals is immeasurable. When you achieve your small goals and get that boost in confidence you can challenge yourself for more. Starting like this will make you a master planner in no time.</p>

<p>BE REALISTIC. Setting unrealistic goals will only lead you to disappointment. Consider your everyday schedule and try to figure out how much time you can (realistically) give to training.</p>

<p><b> 4. Make It R: Relevant </b>
Now here‚Äôs a rather difficult but an important question: Why are setting the goal you‚Äôre setting? Is it really worthwhile or are you really motivated enough to achieve that goal?</p>

<p>I am not trying to demotivate you but creating a goal without a good enough reason attached to it will make it harder for you to stay motivated.</p>

<p>Think about it, why do you want to lose weight? Is it to look more confident in a dress at the party next month? Attaching such reasons to your goals will make them relevant and help you stay motivated till you reach that goal.</p>

<p><b> 5. Make it T: Time-bounded </b>
So when are you planning to start this routine? How much time do you want to give yourself to accomplish that goal?</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs be honest, who doesn‚Äôt love to procrastinate? You‚Äôll never accomplish your goals if you haven‚Äôt set a deadline. We humans need to feel that urgency to actually get serious about anything.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll remind you again: Make sure the time limits you are setting are realistic.</p>

<p>At the same time, stay focused on your goal; don‚Äôt give yourself too much time because that will make you lethargic.</p>

<p>Obviously, making your goals time bounded will also help you in tracking your progress.</p>
